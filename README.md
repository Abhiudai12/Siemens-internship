# MethanODE : A Unified Neural ODE for Methane Combustion Kinetics

This repository presents **MethanODE**, a deep learning model based on **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)** designed to simulate the evolution of **53 chemical species** and **temperature** in **CH‚ÇÑ/Air combustion**.

Developed as part of Siemens' Industrial AI assignment by

##  Model Architecture

MethanODE consists of a shared encoder-decoder Neural ODE that models all species and temperature jointly as a coupled dynamical system. This approach allows the network to learn inter-species interactions more effectively than the traditional ChemNODE sequential training.

        ‚Ä¢	A shared encoder-decoder model built using Neural ODEs
        ‚Ä¢	53 species + temperature modeled as a coupled ODE system
        ‚Ä¢	Each output channel corresponds to a species or temperature prediction

### Table 3: Loss Function Comparison

- ChemNODE:
  - Basic MSE on integrated trajectories
  - No spike weighting or gradient penalties
- MethanODE:
  - Composite loss = **Weighted MSE** + **Gradient Loss**
